Four Seasons

The four seasons of woman, not by colour but by emotion, maturity, love, life and pain
Spring

Spring: she breaks just like a little girl ... but she looks like a quick learner

Summer

Summer: girl, no pearl, a little flushed in the cheek ... either contemplating bed or just indulged I think

Autumn

Autumn: the crying game ... maybe no stranger to a breaken heart ... or possibly the heartbreaker
