The four seasons of woman, not by colour but by emotion, maturity, love, life and pain

![Spring]({{site.baseurl}}/img/spring.jpg)

Spring: she breaks just like a little girl ... but she looks like a quick learner

![Summer]({{site.baseurl}}/img/summer.jpg)

Summer: girl, no pearl, a little flushed in the cheek ... either contemplating bed or just indulged I think

![Autumn]({{site.baseurl}}/img/autumn.jpg)

Autumn: the crying game ... maybe no stranger to a breaken heart ... or possibly the heartbreaker

![Winter]({{site.baseurl}}/img/winter.jpg)

Winter: the ice queen has been around the emotional block a few times ... I wouldn't mess with this one
