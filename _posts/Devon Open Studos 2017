This year Avenda will be participating in Devon Open Studios 

Devon Open Studios is a unique opportunity to meet artists in their studios in some of the most beautiful, unexplored parts of Devon. In addition to being able to buy art direct from the creator, many demonstrate, give talks or give you a chance to have a go.

A cornucopia of art is on offer across Devon when over 200 resident artists and crafts people open their studios to show and sell their individual artworks to the public each September. The diversity of studios is remarkable; as here you can explore venues ranging from potterâ€™s studios in meadows to medieval barns, sinuous sculpture gardens or garrets by the sea. These hidden havens reveal fascinating work in every medium that allows the opportunity to purchase affordable art, directly from the artist, and without gallery commission.
