It's the 21st century and the corsets are off

“Revenge is a dish best eaten cold. The gloves, and corsets, are off now. You should have done your history Mr Policeman. Book of Judith, Holofernes. Quite clever people us women. We can play cat and mouse too.” Emmeline Pankhurst

Supporting Dreadnaught Southwest's touring play The Cause this fifth paining in the series The Corsets Are Off sees Mrs Pankhurst
from a 21st century viewpont. It took women a while, but the results are finally bearing some fruit in 2018.

Homaging the Klimt painting of Judith I and the biblical story of the widow who saved her people (by seducing the leader of the besieging army, then cutting off his head) Avend's Emmmeline Pankhurst has turned the tables on the cat and mouse game the police played with the suffragettes.

Women will no longer be compelled to be beautiful for their audience; only for themselves, and on their own terms. These portraits free the sitters of Holbein, Vermeer and Klimt from the constraints of corsets and convention. The corsets are off, and they are not going back on.
