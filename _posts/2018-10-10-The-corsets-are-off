It's the 21st century and the corsets are off

“Revenge is a dish best eaten cold. The gloves, and corsets, are off now. You should have done your history Mr Policeman. Book of Judith, Holofernes. Quite clever people us women. We can play cat and mouse too.” Emmeline Pankhurst

It’s the 21st century and women will no longer be compelled to be beautiful for their audience; only for themselves, and on their own terms.
These portraits free the sitters of Holbein, Vermeer and Klimt from the constraints of corsets and convention.
So what might these sitters have been thinking? Avenda seeks to give them a modern voice. The corsets are off, and they are not going back on.
