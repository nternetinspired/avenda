Still touring and missing my studio. In Ireland by the sea and the light is watery. Finding a tiny piece of paper very difficult and fiddly, but experimenting with the idea of allegiences/isolation/sharing and inclusion. Just one coat, so might go back in tomorrow and fiddle some more. It's the size of an envelope.
