A member of the Maison des Artistes, Avenda paints and illustrates from her Devon studio ... Atelier Avenda ... overlooking the sea at Teignmouth.
Avenda’s work as an artist, an actor and a publisher allows her that ultimate luxury of a life by the sea.

Following a study of drama, film and art,
both at Exeter University and the University of California (Santa Barbara) she now has the Teign Estuary outside her studio balcony and the salt air blowing across her face.

Her office is known as the ‘wine library’ and when not filming, writing and painting she sings the Blues. Occasionally she kayaks in easy waters.
The terrace faces south and the bottle is always half full.
