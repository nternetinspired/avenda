Working primarily in oils and acrylics, the canvasses are all rooted in real subject matter but have an air of abstraction. Fascinated by the structure of both faces and flowers, Avenda tends to paint big and bold, looking for light and shape, line and focus.

A triptych, Meet The Neanderthals, is the latest work from the atelier. Inspired by the forensically reconstructed skulls of our ancestors, these challenging pieces are powerful indeed.

Other recent work includes a series indebted to The Lovesong of J Alfred Prufrock, a poem by TS Eliot.
