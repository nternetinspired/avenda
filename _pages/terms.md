1. There are no lessons during school holidays or on training days.
A useful rule if thumb is :- if a pupil is at school then there is a lesson!

2. Payment for lessons must be made at the beginning of each calendar
month for all the lessons that month.

3. Payment for lessons may be made by cash, cheque (payable to Mr. L. Cornhill)
or BACS (please put the pupil's name and the month in the reference).

4. If a lesson is missed for any reason, it must still be paid for.
However, I will endeavour to 'make up' missed lessons within seven days
providing sufficient notice of absence has been given and providing
I have a space in my timetable that is mutually convenient.

5. NB: At present, I am unable to offer fortnightly lessons.
