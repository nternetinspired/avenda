This year Avenda will be participating in Devon Open Studios which runs from Saturday 9th - Sunday 24th September 2017.

Devon Open Studios is a unique opportunity to meet artists in their studios in some of the most beautiful, unexplored parts of Devon. In addition to being able to buy art direct from the creator, many demonstrate, give talks or give you a chance to have a go.

A cornucopia of art is on offer across Devon when over 200 resident artists and crafts people open their studios to show and sell their individual artworks to the public each September. The diversity of studios is remarkable; as here you can explore venues ranging from potterâ€™s studios in meadows to medieval barns, sinuous sculpture gardens or garrets by the sea. These hidden havens reveal fascinating work in every medium that allows the opportunity to purchase affordable art, directly from the artist, and without gallery commission.

Venture out on self-guided art tours using our free full colour event guide or just by spontaneously following the yellow arrows scattered about the countryside. Meet the artists, participate in workshops and events, or simply create your own journey of discovery in this most spectacular landscape.
